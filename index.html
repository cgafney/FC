        This is a coding website that I made for a class called Form and Code at Pratt Institute. The programs are generally done in P5JS and everything that one sees, including the website itself, is coded by me through trial and error. While this About page is not the best, I tried to keep it somewhat consistent with what is in the rest of the webpage when what was coded in P5JS is next to text explaining what the code does.
