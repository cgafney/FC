            This is an illusion that I made which seems like rectangles with alternating colors but is more like triangles with alternating colors. Clicking on the illusion itself will change the colors to two random colors and can be changed by clikcing more. Eventually, the color will change back to the original black and white after around 5 seconds of not clicking. By pressing either "]" or "x" on a keyboard, the illusion gets bigger, while pressing "[" or "z" on the keyboard makes the illusion smaller.

            I found that working with for functions can be very confusing, especially if every single value is just a variable and one ends up having 4 different variables for one x vaule of a point for a triangle. The nice thing about this though was that once I was done with doing a more basic sketch, by adding in something that detects when the correct buttons are pressed down I was able to increase and decrease the size of the sketch extremely easily as well as being able to change the color of the sketch.
