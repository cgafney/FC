           <p>
             I was tasked with making (Insert Persons Name Here) gave me a description of an object that they once lost. "The object I lost is a K-Pop Lightstick. Its profile side looks like a yellow crown stuck on top of a black stick handle. The crown onsists of five horns with a tiny white, transparent bead on each peak. There is a yellow button in the shape of a pentagon on one ide of the handle. The botom end of the handle has a open hole with a sling attached. From the top, there is a pentagon in the center of the crown with a big, black character "B" in the middle."
           </p>

          <h1>
             Reflection
           </h1>

           <p>
              The language that (Insert Persons Name Here) was very decriptive and easy to follow. Some parts were questionable, like where the pentagram will be and if one would be able to see it from a side profile. The task of coding this was done in two different parts. First I started with a "line drawing" of the lightstick then went back to add color inside of the strokes.
