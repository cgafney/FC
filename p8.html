          <p>
            A "Bullet Hell" type of game that I tried to make. The chracter is able to move with the keys WASD and uses space to start/restart the game. Currently there is no real penalty for actually running out of lives other than just moving onto the next scene.

            Design Process
          </h1>
          <p>
            The main thing that I wanted to get right was the fluid character movement in relationship to the keys being pressed. After that I used object based coding to make both the character and all of the "Bullets" or enemies that the person has to dodge. Using a simple collision detection code I was able to make the character both change size, speed, and color along with removing one life and the original "Bullet" that hit the character; they are also invulnerable while in this "hitstun" phase.
          </p>
          <h1>
            Reflection
          </h1>
          <p>
            Coding a game is actually pretty fun once you get the hang of it. It can be frustrating when trying to get a mechanic to work just right but once it does, it just feels great. Furthermore I only dislike that if I ever wanted to make something else differently in the future, it requires rewriting a completely different code, so the incetive to change something rather than keeping it as it is was not a lot for the time being.
